The urllib module that we've used is well suited for requesting the contents of a web page but sometimes we need to interact with a web page to obtain the content we need.For example, we might need to submit a form or click a button to display hidden content.

"MechanicalSoup" is a popular and relatively straightforward package to use. MechanicalSoup installs whatâ€™s known as a headless browser, which is a web browser with no graphical user interface. This browser is controlled programmatically via a Python program.
'''

import mechanicalsoup
browser = mechanicalsoup.Browser()

url = "http://olympus.realpython.org/login"

#Browser objects represent the headless web browser. we can use them to request a response of the page from the internet by passing a URL to their .get() method:
page = browser.get(url)
print(page)
#<Response [200]>

#MechanicalSoup uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML from the request, and page has a .soup attribute that represents a BeautifulSoup object:
print(type(page.soup))
#<class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'>

#we can view the HTML by inspecting the .soup attribute:
print(page.soup)
