How to systematically perform tasks
We write down sequence of steps needed to complate the task

#What is a step ? Degree of detail that need to be provided with each step
E.g. Suppose task is to 'Prepare a hall for function' and this can contain many steps:
    1.Cleaning room
    2. preparing stage
    3. Arranging Chairs
    4. etc

But again these steps depends upon degree of detail provided. For e.g. 
For an experienced team we can just say, 'arrange the chairs' and they will do it
But for an un-experienced team, we might need to tell them, 'Arrange chairs in 8 X 10 rows'
Thus, degree of details depends upon the subject experience(machine/language functionlity)
