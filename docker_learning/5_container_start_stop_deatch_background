####Create/run a container
"docker container run image-name command"
E.g. docker container run ubuntu sleep 30 ---- This will create container and run it for 30 second.After 30 second we will come back to prompt.

We can go to other terminal and see this via command "docker container ls"

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                              COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS    NAMES                  
74fae92aa152   ubuntu                                                             "sleep 30"                3 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds            sweet_bell             

####Stop a Container
"docker container stop container-id/container-name"
E.g. docker container stop 74fae92aa152
E.g. docker container stop 74   -- will stop all containers whose container id is starting from 74


####Start a container that is stopped
"docker container start container-id/container-name"
E.g. docker container start 74fae92aa152
E.g. docker container start 74   -- will start all stopped containers whose container id is starting from 74

####Deatch a container - create/run container in background
"docker container run -d image-name command"
E.g. docker container run -d ubuntu sleep 30  -- This will run this container in background and will give us the linux prompt immediately so we can do any other work.


####Interactive - Create/run container in intearctive mode - go inside container
"docker container run -it image-name command"

E.g. jaspreet@NO2NEXXISCAREVM1:~/docker_learning$ docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
root@40d8c411eedf:/# ls       ---- Note this is inside docker, we can install anything inside it just like another linux server
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@40d8c411eedf:/# exit    ---- exit - container will now be stopped & we'll come out of it. We can start it again and it will hv all softwares we installed.
exit

If we want to come out of container & want it to keep running then we can use "ctrl + p + q" instead of exit. 


####Removing/Deleting all container's
docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq)  -- -a gives stopped container as well, -q gives only container id's
