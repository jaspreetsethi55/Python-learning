######docker container create
This will create a container but will not start it

"docker container create image-name command"

"E.g. docker container create ubuntu sleep 60" -- This will create ubuntu container(pull image if not there) with "sleep 60" command

Now, we can use below start command to start this container:
"docker container start 452f" -- where 452f is prefix of container id of above command


######container create vs run
create just creates a container and will not run it while "run" commands create as well as run a container

######container diff
"docker container diff container-id/id-prefix"

This will give us the diff in actual image(we can see via "docker image ls") vs running/created image

E.g. "docker container run -d ubuntu sleep 240" ----- let us say container id prefix is 75552
now, run "docker container diff 75552"  -- this will not show any difference, as we have not made any changes in our running ubuntu image

now, go inside container(via exec) and add/touch file 'a.txt' inside /tmp directory and create directory 'b' inside "/tmp" and we'll see the diff as follows:
C /tmp   -->  Create: because we added a.txt under /tmp
A /tmp/a.txt  --> Add: because we added a.txt under /tmp
A /tmp/b --> Add: because we added directory under /tmp
C /root --> Create: because we run command "sleep 140" and it created new new in root .bash_history
A /root/.bash_history --> Add because we run command "sleep 140" and it created new new in root .bash_history

Below is the completes process.
